# Research Proposal: Adaptive Difficulty Reasoning Training for LLMs

## 1. Research Objective

To develop a novel adaptive difficulty training framework that dynamically calibrates the complexity of reasoning tasks based on the model's evolving capabilities, resulting in more efficient training trajectories and enhanced reasoning performance across diverse domains.

## 2. Research Motivation

Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with static datasets often encounter inefficiencies: easier problems provide minimal learning signals after mastery, while excessively difficult problems may impede learning progress by providing sparse or uninformative gradient signals. A carefully orchestrated progression of task difficulty that adapts to the model's current capabilities promises to:

- Accelerate training convergence and reduce computational resources
- Prevent premature performance plateaus by continuously presenting appropriate challenges
- Enable more nuanced development of reasoning capabilities across subdomains
- Reduce the need for manually curated curriculum design

## 3. Key Research Components

### 3.1 Difficulty Assessment Framework

- Develop metrics to quantify reasoning problem difficulty across domains (mathematics, logic, programming)
- Create methodologies to decompose complex reasoning tasks into atomic components with identifiable difficulty factors
- Establish correlations between problem characteristics and solution success rates
- Design automated difficulty scoring systems that account for both structural complexity and semantic difficulty

### 3.2 Performance Evaluation System

- Design comprehensive evaluation protocols to precisely measure model reasoning capabilities across difficulty levels
- Implement fine-grained performance diagnostics to identify specific reasoning subskills and weaknesses
- Develop metrics to detect overfitting versus genuine reasoning improvement
- Create benchmarks with stratified difficulty levels for consistent progress tracking

### 3.3 Adaptive Sampling Algorithm

- Design a dynamic sampling mechanism that selects training examples based on current model performance
- Implement exploration-exploitation balance to prevent both stagnation and catastrophic forgetting
- Develop methods to identify optimal challenge points (problems slightly beyond current capabilities)
- Create mechanisms to automatically adjust sampling distributions during training

### 3.4 Automatic Problem Generation System

- Develop generative models capable of producing reasoning problems with controlled difficulty parameters
- Implement verification systems to ensure generated problems are well-formed and have unique, verifiable solutions
- Create template-based generation systems for specific reasoning domains (e.g., mathematical word problems, logic puzzles, algorithm challenges)
- Design mechanisms to continuously expand the problem space as model capabilities increase

## 4. Technical Approach

### 4.1 Difficulty Measurement Methods

- **Structural Complexity Analysis**: Quantify reasoning steps, working memory requirements, and conceptual dependencies
- **Solution Path Analysis**: Measure the depth and breadth of the solution search space
- **Information Theoretic Approach**: Apply entropy-based measures to reasoning task structures
- **Empirical Difficulty Calibration**: Use historical model performance data to calibrate difficulty estimates

### 4.2 Adaptive Training Mechanisms

- **Dynamic Batch Composition**: Vary the distribution of problem difficulties within each training batch
- **Progressive Difficulty Scaling**: Gradually increase the proportion of more challenging problems
- **Performance-Based Routing**: Direct specific problem types to models based on their current proficiency
- **Difficulty Gating**: Require mastery at one level before substantial exposure to higher difficulties

### 4.3 Online Learning Components

- **Real-time Performance Assessment**: Continuously evaluate model outputs to update difficulty estimates
- **Response Quality Metrics**: Develop automated measures of reasoning quality beyond binary correctness
- **Uncertainty Measurement**: Leverage model uncertainty as a signal for appropriate difficulty targeting
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Apply RL principles to optimize the curriculum learning policy

## 5. Evaluation Protocol
